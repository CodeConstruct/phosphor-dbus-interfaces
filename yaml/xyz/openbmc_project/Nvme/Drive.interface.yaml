methods:
    - name: Sanitize
      description: >
          Erases all storage user data. This is performed asynchronously, callers can wait
          for a SanitizeCompletion signal.
      parameters:
          - name: SanitizeAction
            type: enum[self.SanitizeActions]
      returns:
          - name: CallToken
            type: uint64
            description: >
                An opaque identifier for this request, to match with SanitizeCompletion signal.
      errors:
          - self.Error.NotSingleStorage
          - self.Error.FirmwareActivationPending
          - self.Error.NamespaceWriteProtected
          - self.Error.ProhibitedPersistentMemory
          - self.Error.DeviceError

properties:
    - name: SanitizeInProgress
      type: boolean
      description: >
          Indicates that a Sanitize operation is in progress.

    - name: SanitizeError
      type: string
      description: >
          Indicates that the last Sanitize method failed.

    - name: SanitizeProgress
      type: double
      description: >
          Indicates the percentage completed of a Sanitize. Based on
          the NVMe Sanitize Status Log SPROG value, converted to a range 
          0.0 to 1.0. Only valid when SanitizeInProgress = true, will be
          set to 0.0 otherwise.
